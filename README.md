Plenty of people to thank for this one:
1. Idea was based off of: http://pomodorotechnique.com/
2. The wonderful patterns (Japanese Sayagata and Dark Embroidery) were from: http://subtlepatterns.com/
3. Hideous CSS is all my own


To run, clone this repo, and in the directory where cloned, run: 

```npm install``` 

and 

``` gulp ```

to run on port 4000.
